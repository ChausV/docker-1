Example (Background):
$ tar xzf teamspeak3-server-linux_x86.tar.gz
$ cd teamspeak3-server-linux_x86
$ ./ts3server_startscript.sh start

ATTENTION!
In some cases, the server process terminates on startup and the error message reads �Server() error
while starting servermanager, error: instance check error�.

As long as you do not use a license key we make sure you only run exactly one instance of the TS3
server free unregistered version. We use shared memory to facilitate the communication to detect
other running instances, which requires tmpfs to be mounted at
/dev/shm.

If you (for whatever reason) do not have this mounted, the above error will occur. To fix this
problem, the following commands or file edits need to be done as root user (or using something like
sudo). This is a temporary fix until your next reboot.

mount -t tmpfs tmpfs /dev/shm

Now, to make sure this mount is done automatically upon reboot edit the file /etc/fstab and add the
line:
tmpfs /dev/shm tmpfs defaults 0 0
